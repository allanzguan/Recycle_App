In our application we want to help the user to navigate information about recycling different types of materials and general recycling rules in the Chicago area. Using either QR-code scanner or manual entry, the user can find out information about recycling: whether specific material can be recycled in the curb-off recycling or has to be taken to the special recycling location which we provide in our application.
